The Dye Injector is an instrument add-on for our emriver models.
It is intended to be used with blue or green dye to inject periodically into the inlet of the river model.
This is particularly useful for videography, photography, or time lapses.
Injecting dye perioically helps maintain color in the water and it is easier to tell what is going on in terms of erosion in the model. 
The length of dye pulse, frequency of dye pulse, color of dye to inject from, or alternating colors can be controlled.
